**Overview**


In this study, we benchmarked and evaluated the classification results of different models for supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios. For supervised learning, the DNN model, which has approximately one-fifteenth the number of parameters as the CNN model, has yielded performance results similar to that of the DNN model.
